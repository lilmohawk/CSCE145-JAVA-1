# CSCE145-JAVA-1
This is my first project for my Java CSCE 145 class at the University of South Carolina-Sumter

In this project I learned the basics of java like taking in user input, displaying to the console, while looops, making switches and if statements.

The objective was to count how many vowels were in a users name, tell the user the perimeter of a triangle, and to tell the user what range their letter grade was in.
